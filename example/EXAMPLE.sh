# This is an example of ProEST.sh usage
# In this example, 20 simulations of BPTI have been made and, to avoid heavy files,
# only the coordinates of alpha carbons (CA) have been saved in trajectory files
# A parameter-topology file that matches the atoms of the trajectories has been 
# made using ante-MMPBSA.py.
# We are now going to check using 20 molecular dynamics if the concatenation of
# 4 trajectories is going to be enough to converge the essential space using
# 1, 3 or 4 vectors (we skip the case of 2 vectors). The atoms included in the analysis
# are alpha carbons from residues 4 to 55 (we remove N and C terminal residues). To make 
#a cumulative distribution function of RMSIP values we will use 20 samples. 
# (In real life experiments one whould make at least more than 500 samples to avoid
# statistical inaccuracy and also there is no reason to skip the analysis of an essential 
# space formed by 2 vectors)

# To understand the usage of the script please run
#
#     ../ProES.sh -h
